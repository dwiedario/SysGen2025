Pseudo Bulk analysis
	UMAP etc
	Age specific DE
	is it sex specific?
	Volcano, Heatmap, GO...
	maybe WGCNA



Single cell
	Cluster cells, assign cell type
	repeat same but cell type specific
	Changes in cell type proportions with age ?



Spatial (does this make sense? i think the spatial thing would be including all data)
	maybe identify L1-L6 regions via marker genes?

	Take top DE genes -> calculate score
	Visualize score spatially for time points
