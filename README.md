# Systems Genomics – Age-Dependent Transcriptomic Changes in the Mouse Motor Cortex

This project investigates how gene expression in the **mouse motor cortex** changes across the lifespan. Using bulk RNA-seq data from animals of different ages and both sexes, the analysis focuses on identifying:

- **Age-dependent transcriptional changes**
- **Sex-specific differences in ageing trajectories**
- **Biological processes and pathways** underlying these shifts

The goal is to characterise how ageing influences molecular programs in the brain, with emphasis on inflammation, neuroplasticity, and cellular homeostasis. The project replicates and extends core findings from the literature by applying a reproducible analysis workflow—from preprocessing to differential expression and functional interpretation.

Key outcomes include:
- Gene-level expression profiles across age groups  
- Differential expression signatures for ageing and sex  
- Visual summaries (PCA, heatmaps, GO networks) to interpret ageing trajectories  

This repository contains all code used to perform the computational analysis and generate the figures presented in the accompanying report/slides.
